                  <p>India is the world’s second most populous country, with a population density of 325 persons per sq km (843 per sq mi). This large and rapidly increasing population contributes to many environmental problems, including deforestation, water pollution, and air pollution.

                      India has a severe air pollution problem generated by industrial effluents and vehicle emissions. Water-treatment facilities have not kept pace with the increase in urban populations, and pollution of rivers and groundwater is a significant and worsening problem. Another major problem is toxic waste, generated by industry and deposited in rivers and oceans and on low-lying land within factory boundaries. The large number of small industrial workshops makes it difficult to enforce laws against industrial waste pollution.
                      
                      A National Wildlife Action Plan provides a framework for species protection and directs the establishment of a protected areas network covering all the major habitat types. In 2004 about 5 percent of India’s land area was under protection, in 539 separate protected areas. India has a national goal of covering one-third of its land area with existing or planted forests. India has had tremendous success with species conservation. World-renowned programs include Project Tiger, which has established nine special tiger reserves, and the Crocodile Breeding and Management Project. Many nongovernmental organizations aid India’s conservation efforts.</p>
